	<h1> Your best American Girl</h1>
	<h2> By Mitski </h2>

 <!--Paste your lyrics below -->
<p> If I could, I'd be your little spoon <br>
And kiss your fingers forevermore <br>
But, big spoon, you have so much to do <br>
And I have nothing ahead of me <br>
You're the sun, you've never seen the night <br>
But you hear its song from the morning birds.<br>
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star <br>
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds... <br>
Don't wait for me, I can't come. </p>
